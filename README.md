# Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi-RPA
This is for Portfolio Website for RPA Developer Job

Greetings! My name is Steven Tjayadi, and I'm excited to share my skill of developing new skill in Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects or self development projects, each of which covers essential skills and techniques for Robotic Process Automation.

# Microsoft Power Automate - Purchase Order Approval Automation from Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations 
- This project use Power Automate in Cloud flow to automatically connect the event of purchase order workflow from Microsoft Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations. The process of Purchase Order will automatically send an email of each selected users in Purchased Order Workflow (Dynamic 365) who will approved it (one of selected users). Then it will automatically send an email notification to selected users and execute an action in Dynamic 365 from Microsoft Platform so the users can submit the purchase order approval in multiple device such as mobile and email (not only in Microsoft Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations).  
- Tools : Microsoft Power Automate (Cloud), Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations (Purchase Order Workflow)
- Output : [Power Automate Approval PO Project](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi-RPA/assets/57402512/325f3285-929d-41c1-8255-fb508fed2256)


# UiPath Studio - Virtual Assistant of Laptop Recommendation System with the help of Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

- This project use Python with the open-source Tensorflow Library that consists using Recurrent Neural Network and Text Processing. This app has also use UiPath Studio for Scraping the laptop data (Bhinneka) and QA Dialogue data (Quora) from different website. This app has been tested by 30 Participants with each review of the Recommendation laptop chatbot and has already been accepted by ICITDA organization. This app has been created by myself and with my co-author Mrs Viny Christanti Mawardi. This Project use a combination of Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning technique. 
- Tools : Python, Tensorflow, UiPath Studio, Flask, SQLite, Web Development (HTML,CSS,Javascript)
- Output (Website) : [Virtual Assistant Kiryubot](http://valaptop.labirariset.com).
- Output (Format)  : [Result of User of Chatbot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec511be-e7f7-4789-ad79-8557e4efa38d)


# UiPath Studio - Certification Validation Automation of Lintar (Graduation of Student)

- This project is created a workflow automation (RPA) with UiPath Studio and connect into Lintar website to automatically check each student graduates for each certificate and category they got before graduation. This project use UiPath Studio with the help of OCR packages and Python which are the one of the computer vision method to gather the text data. This project was also get helped with Cynthia Natalie in creating a Levenstein Distance Algorithm in UiPath Studio to match the text data in Certificate and prevent error of words. The Estimate of automation in each Student Account is 15 seconds depends of how many uploaded student certificate in SKPI for the graduation. 
- Tools : UiPath Studio, UiPath cloud Orchestrator, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, Web Development (UiPath Apps & ASP.NET)
- Output : [Certificate Valid Data Account](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/7a7d79b8-7420-480a-bb14-3b94a786ed84)

# UiPath Studio - SINTA & Kemendikbud of Tarumanagara Lecturer data using Web Scrapping

- This project create an workflow automation (RPA) to scrap the data from website and store the Lecturer data into excel for each of the Lecturer names and Departments like Law, IT, and Economic. This project use UiPath Studio with using the selector method for web Scraping in UiPath. This method also use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract OCR from Python Language (In Sinta Journal Website).
  This review get 2200 data of the Accuracy 80 % of Lecturer in Tarumanagara University include the different subject like (Economics, IT, Law, etc).
- Tools : UiPath Studio, Python (TvExtract), Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server
- Output : [Dosen Sinta](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/75ef6423-05a9-4007-a59d-642d2c238237)

# UiPath Studio - Employee Onboarding System Automation [ICStar Hackathon 2021 Indosat Use-Case]

- This project use UiPath Studio to automate the Account of the Onboarding Employee in Indosat from Excel data (SAP) to store data. This project was created together with Jeremy Moses, Jauharul Arifin, and myself. The estimate automation model in each employee account is 3 minutes for each 1 employee and the 13 process inside of it.
- Tools : UiPath Studio, Microsoft Excel, UML Diagram Maker, Microsoft Outlook, Drawio (Diagram.NET)
- Output : [Sample Output of getting Employee Facilities](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/1e5228f4-3ba2-42e2-9e69-ab18e38170d7)
