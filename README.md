# Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi-RPA
This is for Portfolio Website for RPA Developer Job

Greetings! My name is Steven Tjayadi, and I'm excited to share my skill of developing new skill in Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive catalog of projects or self development projects, each of which covers essential skills and techniques for Robotic Process Automation.

# Power Automate - Approval Purchase Order Automation from Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations 
- This project use Power Automate in Cloud flow to automatically connect the event of purchase order workflow from Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations. The process of Purchase Order will automatically send an email of each selected users in Purchased Order Workflow (Dynamic 365) who will approved it (one of selected users). Then it will automatically send an email notification and execute an action in Dynamic 365 from Microsoft Platform so the users can submit the approval purchase order in multiple device such as mobile and email (not only in Dynamic 365 Finance & Operations).  
- Tools : Microsoft Power Automate (Cloud)
- Output : [Power Automate Approval PO Project](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi-RPA/assets/57402512/325f3285-929d-41c1-8255-fb508fed2256)


# UiPath Studio - Laptop Recommendation System with Recurrent Neural Network

- This project use Python with the open-source Tensorflow for using Recurrent Neural Network and Text Processing. This app has also use UiPath Studio for Scraping the laptop data and QA Dialogue data. This app has been tested by 30 Participants with each review of the Recommendation laptop chatbot and has already been accepted by ICITDA organization. This app has been created by myself and with my co-author Mrs Viny Christanti Mawardi. This Project use a combination of Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning technique. 
- Tools : Python, Tensorflow, UiPath Studio, Flask, SQLite, Web Development (HTML,CSS,Javascript)
- Output : [Virtual Assistant Kiryubot](http://valaptop.labirariset.com).

# UiPath Studio - Certification Validation

- This project use UiPath Studio with the help of OCR packages with Python which is one of the computer vision method to gather the text data. This project was also get helped with Cynthia Natalie in creating a Levenstein Distance Algorithm in UiPath Studio to Matching the text data in Certificate to prevent error of words. The Estimate of automation in each Student Account is 15 seconds depends of how many uploaded student certificate. 
- Tools : UiPath Studio, UiPath cloud Orchestrator, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, Web Development (UiPath Apps & ASP.NET)
- Output : [Certificate Valid Data Account](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/7a7d79b8-7420-480a-bb14-3b94a786ed84)

# UiPath Studio - SINTA Dosen & Kemendikbud Untar Web Scrapping

- This project use UiPath Studio with using the selector method for web Scraping in UiPath. This method also use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract OCR from Python Language.
  This review get 2200 data of the Accuracy 80 % of Untar Dosen include the different subject like (Economics, IT, Law, etc).
- Tools : UiPath Studio, Python (TvExtract), Microsoft Excel, Microsoft SQL Server
- Output : [Dosen Sinta](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/75ef6423-05a9-4007-a59d-642d2c238237)

# UiPath Studio - Employee Onboarding System Automation [ICStar Hackathon 2021 Indosat Use-Case]

- This project use UiPath Studio to automate the Account. The Master data gathering use Microsoft Excel to store the data. This project was created together with Jeremy Moses, Jauharul Arifin, and myself. The estimate automation model in each employee account is 3 minutes for each 1 employee and the 13 process inside of it.
- Tools : UiPath Studio, Microsoft Excel, UML Diagram Maker, Microsoft Outlook, Drawio (Diagram.NET)
- Output : [Sample Output of getting Employee Facilities](https://github.com/stevenkiryu/Portfolio-Steven-Tjayadi/assets/57402512/1e5228f4-3ba2-42e2-9e69-ab18e38170d7)
